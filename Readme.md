# Set up environment and run project

### Set up
1. Need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Have one package manager tool. Seems there already has a **npm**, when you installed node or you can install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) by yourself.
3. Run Command: `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies.

### Run
1. Run first week: `npm run week1` or `yarn week1`.
2. Run second week: `npm run week2` or `yarn week2`.
3. Run third week: `npm run week3` or `yarn week3`.

PS: When the project is running and you change the source file then save, the page in brower can be auto-reloaded.
